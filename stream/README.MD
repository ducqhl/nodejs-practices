# STREAM

## What is Stream?

In computer science, a stream is a sequence of data elements made available over time.

Streams are collections of data - just like arrays or strings. The differentis that streams might not be available all at once, and they dont have to fit in memory. => This makes streams really powerful when working with large amounts of data, or data thats coming from an external source one `chunk` at a time.

Streams also give us the power of composability in our code.
Just like we can compose powerful linux commands by piping other smaller Linux commands, we can do exactly the same in Node with streams.

```bash
~/ducqhle $ grep -R exports * | wc -l
```

```javascript
grep.pipe(wc);
```

## What is streaming data?

Data that is continously generated by different sources. Such data should be processed incrementally using Stream Processing techniques without having access to all of the data.

## What NodeJS Stream

A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in NodeJS.

## How many types of streams in NodeJS.

- Writable: streams to which data can be written (eg. `fs.createWriteStream)`).
- Readble: streams from which data can be read (eg. `fs.createReadStream()`).
- Duplex: streams that are both Readable and Writable (eg. `net.Socket`).
- Transform: 
    - Are Duplex streams where the output is in some way related to the input. 
    - Streams which read input, process the data manipulating it, and then outputing new data.
